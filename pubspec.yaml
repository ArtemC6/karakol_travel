# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/icon/
    - assets/translations/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:


#  fonts:
#    - family: googleFontBold
#      fonts:
#        - asset: fonts/googlesansebold.ttf
  #    - family: googleFontMedium
  #        fonts:
  #            - asset: fonts/googlesansmedium.ttf
  #    - family: googleFontThin
  #        fonts:
  #            - asset: fonts/googlesansregular.ttf

  #     fonts:
  #       - family: googleFontBold
  #         fonts:
  #           - asset: fonts/googlesansmedium.ttf
  #       - family: googleFontMedium
  #         fonts:
  #           - asset: fonts/googlesansmedium.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
